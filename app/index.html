                <p>Here are the results of the 2024 presidential election, a historic race that took an unexpected turn when incumbent President Joe Biden withdrew from the race in March 2024, citing health concerns. Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in as the Democratic nominee, choosing Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.</p>

                <p>The outcome surprised many observers, as polls had consistently shown Vice President Harris leading in the months before election day, with her message of generational change resonating strongly with voters.</p>
                <p>But should we really be surprised?</p>
                <p>The dramatic shift in Democratic leadership mid-campaign created an unprecedented scenario that traditional polls struggled to capture accurately.</p>
                <p>We're going to examine prediction markets alongside traditional polling data to see how they reacted to key events throughout the campaign.</p>
                <p>This analysis will help us understand whether prediction markets may be better indicators of election outcomes compared to traditional polls, especially in scenarios of significant political upheaval.</p>

            <div class="step-content">
                <h2>What are Prediction Markets?</h2>
                
                <p>Prediction markets are like betting markets for real-world events. Instead of betting on sports, people bet on election outcomes.</p>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>How do they work?</h3>
                    <div class="comparison-grid">
                        <div class="comparison-item">
                            <h4>Buying</h4>
                            <p>If you think Trump will win and his contracts cost $0.60, you can buy them. If he wins, each contract pays $1.00.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="comparison-item">
                            <h4>Selling</h4>
                            <p>If you think Trump will lose, you can sell contracts. If he loses, contracts are worth $0.00 and you keep the money.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>The price of a contract shows what people think will happen. A price of $0.60 means the market thinks there's a 60% chance of winning.</p>
                
                <p>Why might prediction markets be better than polls? Because people are betting real money, they:</p>
                <ul class="hypothesis-list">
                    <li>Think carefully before betting</li>
                    <li>React quickly to new information</li>
                    <li>Consider all available evidence</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Let's see how these markets performed during the 2024 election.</p>

                <p>This looks familiar, doesn't it? You may think that this is just an electoral map, but it's actually a visualization of the prediction markets' expectations for the outcome of the election.</p>
                <p>Keep an eye out for sudden changes in the map, particularly across the swings states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.</p>

              <h2>Key Events</h2>
              <p>Did you notice that around early July, a bunch of the swing states turned red? Primarily the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.</p>
              <p>Well, that's because there were a few key events that affected the race.</p>
              <p>Let's take a look at how some of these events influenced both traditional polls and prediction markets.</p>

                <h2>Arbitrage Opportunities</h2>
                <p>Arbitrage is a simple but powerful concept: it's the ability to profit from price differences between markets.</p>
                <p>Imagine you could buy a Trump contract for $0.50 on one market and simultaneously sell it for $0.52 on another. That $0.02 difference is pure profit, with no risk!</p>
                <p>Below, we track these opportunities between Kalshi and Polymarket throughout the campaign. The slider lets you explore different moments in time:</p>
