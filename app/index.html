                <p>Here are the results of the 2024 presidential election, a historic race that took an unexpected turn when incumbent President Joe Biden withdrew from the race in March 2024, citing health concerns. Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in as the Democratic nominee, choosing Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.</p>

                <p>The outcome surprised many observers, as polls had consistently shown Vice President Harris leading in the months before election day, with her message of generational change resonating strongly with voters.</p>
                <p>But should we really be surprised?</p>
                <p>The dramatic shift in Democratic leadership mid-campaign created an unprecedented scenario that traditional polls struggled to capture accurately.</p>
                <p>We're going to examine prediction markets alongside traditional polling data to see how they reacted to key events throughout the campaign.</p>
                <p>This analysis will help us understand whether prediction markets may be better indicators of election outcomes compared to traditional polls, especially in scenarios of significant political upheaval.</p>

                <p>Before we dive in, let's understand what prediction markets are and why they might be better at forecasting election outcomes than traditional polls.</p>

                            <h4>Traditional Polls</h4>

                                <li>Ask people who they plan to vote for</li>

                            <h4>Prediction Markets</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>People bet real money on outcomes</li>
                                <li>Prices reflect collective wisdom</li>
                                <li>Financial incentive to be accurate</li>
                                <li>Self-correcting through arbitrage</li>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Think of prediction markets like a stock market, but instead of trading company shares, people buy and sell "shares" in election outcomes. If you think Trump has a 70% chance of winning but his contracts are trading at 60¢ (implying a 60% chance), you might buy them expecting to profit.</p>
                
                <p>Our hypothesis is simple: when people put their money where their mouth is, they're more likely to:</p>
                <ul class="hypothesis-list">
                    <li>Consider all available information, not just their preferences</li>
                    <li>Account for factors that polls might miss</li>
                    <li>Update their positions quickly when new information emerges</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Let's test this hypothesis by examining how both polls and prediction markets reacted to key events in the 2024 election.</p>

                <p>This looks familiar, doesn't it? You may think that this is just an electoral map, but it's actually a visualization of the prediction markets' expectations for the outcome of the election.</p>

              <p>Did you notice that around early July, a bunch of the swing states turned red? Primarily the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.</p>
              <p>Well, that's because there were a few key events that affected the race.</p>
              <p>Let's take a look at how some of these events influenced both traditional polls and prediction markets.</p>

                <h2>Arbitrage Opportunities</h2>
                <p>Arbitrage is a simple but powerful concept: it's the ability to profit from price differences between markets.</p>
                <p>Imagine you could buy a Trump contract for 50¢ on one market and simultaneously sell it for 52¢ on another. That 2¢ difference is pure profit, with no risk!</p>
                <p>Below, we track these opportunities between Kalshi and Polymarket throughout the campaign. The slider lets you explore different moments in time:</p>
